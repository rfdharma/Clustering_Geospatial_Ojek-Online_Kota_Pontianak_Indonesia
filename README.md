# Clustering_Geospatial_Ojek-Online_Kota_Pontianak_Indonesia

Background:

Online motorcycle taxi booking has become one of the increasingly popular transportation services in various cities in Indonesia. From booking rides for people to courier services related to goods or food delivery. Have you ever thought about being a driver or customer who often complains about service delays, difficulty in finding a driver/customer, difficulty in determining the right pick-up/drop-off time, and unstable and non-transparent prices? In this case, our machine learning project has decided to identify these problems from various perspectives using data for the learning model sourced from the customer booking history in the city of Pontianak, Indonesia. The data comes from Pontianak Digital Stream (PDS) published through the West Kalimantan provincial data website.

Objectives:

1. To help identify areas with high demand for online motorcycle taxi services. This allows online motorcycle taxi platforms to place more drivers in those areas, reducing wait times for users.
2. To help determine more accurate prices so that prices offered to users can be more transparent and in line with market conditions.
3. To understand customer behavior and help optimize potential service development to improve user experience by identifying patterns in customer booking behavior.

Benefits:

The results of our machine learning analysis enable companies/governments that manage online motorcycle taxi services to identify areas frequently used by customers/drivers, provide more transparent information, optimize resources to enhance user experience, and identify customer groups and behavior.
